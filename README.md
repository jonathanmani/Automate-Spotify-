# Automate Spotify Playlist

This program will take a playlist of songs from Youtube and automatically search for those songs and create a playlist in Spotify.
It will do this in 5 steps: 


Step 1: Log into YouTube
Step 2: Get Liked Videos
Step 3: Create a new Playlist in Spotify
Step 4: Search for the song
Step 5: Add this song to the new Spotify Playlist

## Some things to consider
Spotify will not make a playlist of songs if it doesn't have it in its library
